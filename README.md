Alternate viewer for library of saved Spotify albums

Head to library.cha-king.com to see it in action!

## Description
As much as I love Spotify, I miss the days of having an iPod or iTunes where, if I didn't know what to listen to, I could search through my library to find some forgotten gems.

Unfortunately, Spotify rather strangely makes it very hard to view your library by artist/album.

This app provides an alternate means of accessing your Spotify library.

You can find a more in-depth write-up [here](https://blog.cha-king.com/projects/2020/10/22/spotify-viewer.html).
